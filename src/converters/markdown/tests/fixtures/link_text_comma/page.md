# Meeting Rituals

- [From the team at Lattice,](https://engineering-lattice.webflow.io/article/designing-team-rituals) they *"call this ritual our Monday "warmup," and we basically fill out a Notion doc in real-time, which helps guide our discussion. We spend the time sharing kudos, learnings, and updates about what we're focused on that week. It's a feel-good meeting that kicks the week off right."*
