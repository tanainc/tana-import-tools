# 👨‍💻 How to use

This project consists of a [JSON specification](https://github.com/tagrhub/tana-import-tools/blob/main/src/types/types.ts) of our common import format for Tana, as well as a set of converters which turn other formats into this format.

If you need to do some something special with your data before putting it into Tana you can just fork this project and hack the current converters into doing what you need. As long as the resulting file follows the format you will be able to import it into Tana.

If you are making changes that you think will benefit other users, please create a pull request.

#### Installing

1. Install Node.js 22.x https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Use npm (comes with Node 22). No Yarn required.
3. Download or git clone this tana-import-tools (or as-of-yet-unmerged branch you want to test, such as logseq)
4. In that folder, in terminal, type `npm install`
5. Export your existing PKM data (roam, logseq) to that folder and name it appropriately, e.g., `logseq.json`
6. Type the appropriate command for your conversion, e.g., `npm run convert:logseq logseq.json` where convert: can have roam, notion, logseq, or other formats
7. In Tana, go to the top right menu and `import`
8. Hopefully everything worked! If not, report back to [#tana-import-tools](https://tanacommunity.slack.com/archives/C044X2ZC335)
