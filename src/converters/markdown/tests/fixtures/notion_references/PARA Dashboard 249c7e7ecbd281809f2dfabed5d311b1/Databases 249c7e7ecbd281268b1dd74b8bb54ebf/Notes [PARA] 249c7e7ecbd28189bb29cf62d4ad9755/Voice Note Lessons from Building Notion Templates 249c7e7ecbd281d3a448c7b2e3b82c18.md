# Transcript

Can I just take a minute to soak this in? This is such a cool experience. Finally getting to meet so many of you that I talked to online in person. So today, I'm gonna share some of the most important lessons that my team and I have learned in building a successful templates business for Notion.

Over the past few years, we've served over 30,000 customers, and we've made over $2,500,000 in revenue solely from Notion templates. These are one time purchases, no recurring subscriptions, no consulting upsells, just templates. I wanna share as much as I can from what we've learned from this experience with you today. But I wanna start off with a story that's really important to me.

And this story isn't about Notion. In fact, it goes back 15 years ago to probably a time before Ivan and Simon and everyone else involved in Notion had even started thinking about this particular app. I wanna take you back to 2,009 when I was just out of high school. This is me working my cornfield job in Iowa.

And this was the summer that I had to choose my college major. And when I finally made my selection, I chose to major in business. Now I find business fairly interesting, but I chose to major in business for one major reason. And that reason is that I chose not to major in engineering even though I'm very interested in engineering.

Technical things fascinate me. I love code. I love computers. I thought I would work in computer networking for a time when I was in high school.

I chose to major in business instead. And the reason that I shied away from computer engineering and I went down the dark path toward business school, joined the dark side, is because I thought if I went for engineering, I would fail. I thought I was too stupid for it. But why did I believe that in the first place?

Maybe some of you can relate. I genuinely thought I was too stupid for computer engineering. And when you look at how I did in high school, that seems a little bit confusing because I didn't generally struggle in high school. I got good grades.

I was even a year ahead in math, but that actually ended up being the reason for it. You see, when I started school, I found math to be fairly easy. Breeze through basic math, did very well in algebra, trigonometry was fine, geometry was fine. But when I got to calculus in my senior year, I hit a wall.

I really, really struggled with it, or I should actually say I should have struggled with it, but there were a couple of things that prevented me from having to go through that struggle. One of them was that our teacher gave out just a little bit too much extra credit. Anybody else get extra credit from their teachers in high school or in college? Yeah.

Usually, you have to do extra work to get extra credit. He had this policy where if we said hi to him in the hall, we'd get a point. And we could do this at any time of the day. He was a basketball coach, so he single handedly increased attendance to the basketball games, specifically by math students by a lot because we were all stalking him at basketball games trying to get extra credit points.

But the bigger problem was that in the math department, right outside the classroom where we actually did our learning, there was this commons area where I would do a lot of my studying. And sitting in the middle of a big round table, there was the teacher's edition of our calculus textbook. So the way I did basically every one of my homework assignments is I would come to the comments area. I would try to solve a problem, get stuck, and instead of going through the process of struggling and really having to learn, which can be painful sometimes, I'd give up and I'd reach for the book.

I'd peek at the answer, convince myself I wouldn't do it again, and this pattern established itself through the entire year. Now this meant that my homework grades were pretty solid, and that set my grade up along with me being able to muddle through the tests somehow to be pretty good when I graduated. But I certainly didn't understand calculus. My report card may have signaled that I did, but I didn't know what I was doing.

And so it was with that experience feeling completely lost in all of my calculus homework that I went into the process of choosing my college major. And I remember looking through the syllabi, which is the plural for syllabus if you didn't know, For the engineering programs, computer engineering specifically, I was seeing all these advanced math classes, differential equations, calculus 2, calculus 3, the Empire Strikes Back. And I was like, well, if I couldn't do calculus back in high school, there's no way I could do these things. And I felt the same way about the programming classes, c programming.

There was electronic circuits, logic gates, all these concepts that seemed really intimidating to me because I associated them with my experience in calculus, and so I didn't choose that major. And I skipped out on learning a whole bunch of stuff I was interested in, like programming, like the architecture of computers. Now when I got into my freshman year, I gave computer engineering a little bit of a try. I was majoring in business.

There was one programming class I had to take. There was an easy business version, and there was a hard version for the computer engineering students. I had a lot of friends who went for computer engineering, so I tried to do the class with them. But my same behavioral pattern from calculus came back.

I ended up looking at the answers in the textbook way too often, and I ended up dropping the class after the first exam because I just could not get it, and I convinced myself that I couldn't do it. So that was the major mistake I made in college. Luckily, it has not haunted me forever because a couple of years ago, I decided to start teaching myself how to code. And through that journey, I've hit a lot of points where I felt absolutely stuck.

Like, if any of you have done coding and you've had to deal with recursion, you probably understand this this feeling of having to go through a brick wall with your head. Coding can be tough, especially when you're not willing to let Chat GPT do it all for you. Or maybe we're all clogged fans here. I'm not sure.

But I have stuck with it, and now I know something for sure. I could've handled that engineering major. It would have been tough. Yep.

I would have gotten stuck. I would have had late nights. But if I had had a more tenacious mindset, if I had been willing to push through the problems and believe in myself, I would have handled it. And the only reason that I convinced myself back then I couldn't do it is because, 1, I was afraid of failing, and 2, I had spared myself the formation of that scar tissue I should have gotten in my calculus class.

That's because I looked at the answers all the time. I really wish I hadn't done that, but it's okay. As I mentioned before, it's not too late for me now to start doing things the right way. I'm well past college, 33 years old now.

I've been out of college longer than I was ever in it, but I'm more willing now than ever to throw myself into problems that seem really hard to solve and to learn things that are just frankly tough. I've been teaching myself to code. One project I've been working on over the past few months is a full blown JavaScript library for the Notion API called Notion helper. This allows you to instead of writing the Notion API code that's very verbose directly, you can just write very fluent code like this where you can chain methods.

And this has been a really tough challenge. I've had to wrangle with recursion. I've had to learn a whole bunch of things about JavaScript classes and factory functions and all kinds of things. It's been tough, but it's also been really rewarding.

I've also been working on a full blown Notion web clipper called Flylighter, which I didn't plan for this to be in the talk, but is actually live in the web store today. We were able to get it launched, and this has been a huge learning experience for both myself and my cofounder, Eli, who's done the majority of the coding on the project and design as well. But I've had to learn UI and UX and auto layout in Figma and a lot of layout tools and all these things for this project, things that I had never touched before. What I've learned is that it's never too late to learn something tough.

It's never to, like, try something that scares you. And if you take nothing else away from this talk, I want you to remember that all you have to do is be willing to try hard and be willing to perceive failures as useful feedback instead of the end of the road. And I'm sharing all this with you here, all this information that doesn't seem like it pertains to Notion templates because one of the mistakes I made as a template creator was waiting way too long to launch my first template. The same fear of failure I experienced back in high school in my calculus class reared its ugly head again again when I had the idea for my 1st paid template.

Only this time, it was a sneakier kind of fear. This time, I didn't fear that I couldn't release a template. That's pretty easy. You all know it as much as I do.

Notion makes it very easy to put templates out into the world. And as we saw at the keynote, it's now even easier with marketplace. You can sell templates effortlessly. But this time, I feared that I wouldn't do it perfectly.

I worried that if I launched right away, I'd bring a whole bunch of people to a sales page that wasn't optimized, but I wouldn't have a good sales funnel, and that would lead to a bad conversion rate. I was worried about all these corporate marketing buzzwords. I was worried about all these business buzzwords that so many of us think are super important when we're actually down at level 1 just trying to get started. It's like trying to it's like being worried about doing wheelies when you haven't even learned to ride a bike yet.

And it's caused by this more insidious kind of fear. The kind of fear that gets us saying, I have one chance. If I don't do it perfectly on my first try, I'll burn my chance. So I spent a ton of time reading about sales page optimization.

I was listening to podcasts from people who said they were expert marketers, buying WordPress plugins I didn't need to optimize my sales page, to add these little toast notifications when somebody else added the template to their cart. All of this crap that kept me from launching for way too long. And you wanna know what happened with all of that prep? I hardly used any of it.

I eventually got so fed up with all of the complexity I was heaping up on myself. I eventually got to the point where I said I have to launch that I put my template up on Gumroad. I had been looking through all these more complicated sales funnels. These tools allow you to do upsells and bundling, and I didn't use any of it.

Threw my template up on Gumroad, which at the time was the simplest way to sell an Notion template. Now it isn't, but at the time it was. And I didn't have any of those fancy features to distract me. And it wasn't able to do bundles.

I wasn't able to do upsells. I wasn't able to do any of that. But there was also nothing to hyperfocus on, which would delay my launch any further. And once I launched, I got 2 things.

1st, I got money. From the get go, I earned a few $1,000 in the 1st month because, wouldn't you know it, I emailed the people on my wait list, and I actually sold them something. Isn't that crazy how when you tell people do you have something for sale, they might buy it from you and might actually earn money? And then each month after that, the template started selling more and more as I told more people about it, as other people told other people about it.

But perhaps more importantly than money, I got feedback. Now my product was out in the wild. Now I could no longer hide behind these mental simulations of what I thought might happen. Now I was actually getting to hear from my customers.

I was finding bugs in my product. People were reporting them, and I got to see what kinds of videos and other online content tended to cause sales spikes. This is real feedback, both data driven and anecdotal. And with it, I learned that I can make a ton of real improvements to my products and the way I sold them.

I learned to start correctly and collecting testimonials. I learned to start tweaking my sales page in response to feedback I got from my products. I started answering a ton of support questions as well, which not only helped me to improve the templates, but also drove drove me to become more of a Notion expert because now I was being challenged to solve problems outside of my own personal needs and interests. So I've really broadened and deepened my expertise in this tool at the same time.

So if you came here hoping to learn how to launch a template business, quote, unquote, that's the answer. Build your template, launch it before you think you're ready, and get as much feedback as possible so you can iterate quickly and you can make improvements. And if you're paying attention, I even slipped a few pro tips in there. Again, I want you to remember one thing from this talk, one thing and one thing only.

Build it, launch it before you're ready, and get feedback. But if you're looking for the hot goss, the hot pro tips, collecting testimonials can be a great way to improve your sales pages. We almost never trust what somebody says about themselves and their products as much as we trust what other people say about them, especially other people that we already know and we already like. If you can get testimonials from influencers, if you can get testimonials from, influential figures in smaller communities, that's great.

If you can get testimonials from normal customers, that's great as well. There are tools like Senja or testimonial. t0, which is the one I use, that will allow you to very easily collect testimonials and display them on your sales pages. You can also use Notion forms for free and just put those testimonials up on a sales page by copying and pasting.

Keep it simple. You can also update your sales pages in response to feedback. One thing that we learned with the original version of ultimate brain, which is our personal productivity template, is a lot of people found it to be too complex. So in ultimate brain 2.0, which we launched last year, we added an ultimate brain light page.

This is our, if you're new to notion, go to this page and start here. And we added that to our sales page, which boosted sales because people were like, oh, this is something that is not going to be too overwhelming to me. And you took that directly from customer feedback. And finally, answer support questions.

This can be absolutely fantastic for 1, getting feedback, but for 2, making your customers feel like they are guaranteed to get the solution thereafter because you're not only offering a solution in the form of a product, you're signaling to them we are here to guide you along the way. We're not going to leave you high and dry with just something that you bought. But even with all those pro tips and even with my core message, I might have skipped ahead a little bit. Launch your template is very easy to say, but it leaves a couple of pretty big questions.

Number 1, how do I know what kind of template to even build in the first place? And number 2, once I've built my template, how do I reach my future customers if I don't already have a big online audience? Let's start by throwing that first question out the window because it's frankly the wrong question. The question you should be asking instead of what kind of template do I build is well, actually, I'm gonna let you try to guess what that question is.

And in the meantime, I wanna tell you a little story. So a couple of weeks ago, I went down to LA for Tiago Forte's building a second brain or second brain summit. And fantastic. Did anybody else go to this?

I know Marie did. Yes. So at this event, I met the cofounders of a product called UltraSpeaking. Anyone taking this product?

It's a course. I think it is. So Ultra Speaking is what I've been told, basically, like, Duolingo for public speaking. These it's really gamified experience that helps people get more confident on stage.

And while I haven't taken it myself, I've heard a lot of great feedback about it. But I met the founders at this event, started following them on Twitter and other places, and I saw a video from one of those founders talking about one of the biggest mistakes that speakers make when they're prepping their talks. Essentially, the mistake is that when you have a talk you're prepping, you have a lot of things you wanna say. You got data.

You got stories. You might even have a joke or 2. But the inconvenient truth is that, at best, your audience is going to walk away remembering one thing from your talk, and only if you have one thing in your talk worth remembering. So we're over here as speakers worried about this long list of things that we wanna say, and we think if we don't hit every single one of them, our audience is going to notice.

But instead, what we should really be focused on is what is that one thing? It's not what do I want to say. It's what do I want all of these fine folks in this room to remember? What do I want them to take away from this?

And if you focus on that as a speaker, your job gets way, way easier because you don't you don't have to remember a 1000000 clever things to say. Your talk doesn't have to cover every possible angle of the topic. They wouldn't remember it anyway, so none of that is important. You just need to remember that who your audience is, what they need or want, and what you are uniquely qualified to build, to deliver on those needs or wants.

As a speaker, in short, it's my job to focus on you. How about me? And as a creator of software, of solutions, of templates, of whatever you want to call it, I need to do the exact same thing. It isn't I shouldn't ask what type of Notion template do I want to create.

I should ask what solution does my audience need? What problem can I help them solve with my current skills and interests? In short, don't build a template. Build a solution.

And until you understand what the problem you're solving is, you don't know what form that solution should take. Maybe it is a template or maybe it's a higher touch consulting offering. Maybe it's a course. Maybe it's a browser extension.

For me, the current problem that I wanna solve for my audience is giving them the ability to capture information from the web in a more customizable way and get it as fast as possible into their second brain app of choice. I can't really do that with a template. I can do that with a browser extension and a mobile app like Flylighter. So the problem has to come first.

Now you might be asking, okay. But how do I find that problem? Can't I just be given a template idea and make it? To that, I say no.

You need to find the problem. And on note on the note of finding problems, I wanna tell you another little story. So I actually didn't set out to create Notion templates in the first place. That was never my original goal.

With Thomas Beck explains, my YouTube channel dedicated to Notion tutorials when I got around to thinking about how to monetize it, my initial idea was to build a course. You see, I started I started using Notion in 2018 all the way back before the pandemic as a way to organize my production process for my YouTube channel and for everything else I was running online, blogs, podcasts, all of that stuff. And as I got into creating content around Notion, with a course, I wanted to help other creators who had the same exact problem. They're juggling all of these different tools, and in many cases, they're juggling all these different web properties with our publishing content.

We had multiple YouTube channels, multiple podcasts, multiple blogs. We're trying to get tweets out, newsletters out, and a lot of creators are doing the exact same thing. So in possibly the most meta fashion ever, I signed up for a course that taught course creators how to make better courses. Yes.

It's turtles all the way down. And I thought I was gonna use what I learned in that course to create a great course of my own, take a shot every time you hear a course. But 3 weeks into the classwork, I realized that I could actually serve the people I wanted to help a lot better just by giving them access to the tool I built for myself along with some tutorials. And this wasn't really an obvious thing back then.

Notion templates were a thing, but paid Notion templates are not very popular. I remember seeing posts on the Notion subreddit where people were like, why would anybody ever pay for a Notion template? It's so easy to build anything in Notion. Who would ever buy a template?

It's, yeah, a couple who would concede, yeah, maybe I'd buy a template, but only for, like, $5. But I didn't care about what they were saying because I was over here understanding that I had started from the perspective of I have a problem. I'm juggling all these tools to manage my business as a creator. We're making a good amount of revenue every month doing this.

I wanna do it better. And I've built a system here that represents essentially custom built software. There's no other tool in the market that does what my Notion template does, and Notion doesn't do what my template does out of the box. I had built a solution to solve a business problem that my team had, and I was confident there was a lot of other creators out there who had the exact same problem and that they would value this solution at far more than $5.

So I turned my system into a template called creator's companion. This is my first paid Notion template. This was the one that I put up on Gumroad. And, of course, after making my early mistake of overthinking everything involved in my launch on my sales page and all that jazz, I put it up on Gumroad and I charged a $150, and then people started to buy it.

Now I wasn't guaranteed to be right about this pricing bet. I could have been wrong, but I felt conviction about it because I'd already experienced this problem for myself. And that is a great way to discover your initial problem. What currently bugs you?

What kind of work are you doing? What is your day job? What are you trying to build? What do you want to exist in the world?

Can you build something that solves that problem for you? So many great products have been built with this exact same motivation. And sure, there are other ways to find problems. You could do market research, you could do surveys, you could hire KPMG or some big high powered consultancy to come in, send a couple of bobs into your office, look at trends, and give you a great business idea.

You could look at business gurus on YouTube, talking about 5 side hustle ideas you can start today. But personally, I've never really been able to summon much motivation to solve tough problems unless I have either experienced the problem myself or if other people in a community that I feel deeply connected to are experiencing that problem. I think that's why even today, I hang out on the Notion subreddit and I solve formula problems for people because I feel connected to this community. Y'all are my people.

I like helping you solve problems. And if I can make a decent living for me and my team while doing it, I'll take it. So if you wanna find a good problem that can lead to a great business idea, that can lead to a great product, my suggestion is to first look at what bugs you, and then look in the communities you're a part of and see what's bugging those people. What do they really wish they could do?

Get your ear to the ground, get involved in your community, find problems that way. And it can be a small problem at first. Right? Creator's Companion does a lot more now than it did at launch, a heck of a lot now more now than it did when I first had my first idea of what it could be.

It started as a b roll shot list organizer. It was a single database, and then it just expanded from there. Ultimate brain started as a task list in Notion, and then I started thinking, what if I could have my tasks and my notes really well integrated and added more and more from there based on feedback? Start with a really small idea.

Now let's say you have your idea, you got your problem, and you know what kind of solution you wanna build. Maybe you have a project manager for, professional pet sitters that comes with a mini course on client retention, Or maybe you are a nerd like I am and you love playing Magic the Gathering, and you wanna build an inventory tracker or inventory management system for people who run local card shops, who sell Magic the Gathering singles or Pokemon cards. Next question is, how do you reach your future customers? And it's here that I wanna, introduce a couple of different concepts.

The first of which is called lighthouses. So if you think about your potential customers, the audience who doesn't yet know you, as ships that are sailing of the dark waters of the Internet or the even darker waters of the real world, then you have a couple of ways that you can get them to shore. The first is by lighting a lighthouse. Here, you're creating a central beacon in the dark that can guide them to shore, that can guide them to your solution.

And to be clear, this is just a cool metaphorical way of saying create content. Every time you create videos, you create shorts, you create live streams, tweets, even cringe on LinkedIn, you're creating these little lighthouses in the dark that could lead your potential customers to you. And this is my primary strategy. So this is what I can really tell you the most about.

In 2020, I created a YouTube channel called Thomas Frank explains. Tried to think of a clever name, couldn't do it, went with something really generic, but this entire YouTube channel is dedicated to helping people learn Notion from scratch. And we have different kinds of lighthouses which are designed to meet different people where they currently are. You see, I wanna help people learn Notion from soup to nuts, and I wanna give them great tools for doing their work in Notion.

But I realized that there are different contexts in which people want to learn. Sometimes people are looking for a very specific solution to a problem. Sometimes people have ordered a bowl of poke for lunch. They're sitting down, like, I wanna watch something useful, but also entertaining on YouTube.

What's going up in my feed? So we have different lighthouses that we liked. You might call these content pillars. We've got Notion feature release videos, which I will be making a lot next week.

This is basically news coverage covering all the new features that Notion is launching and teaching people how to use them. We have full build guides which start from the perspective of we wanna solve a problem or we wanna build some sort of useful tool, and I show them step by step how to do it, like this habit tracking video. We have edutainment style videos. These are good lunchtime videos, like this video on the top 10 beginner Notion mistakes, and we have advanced videos, like this 2 hour guide to the Notion API.

Probably the video that I'm most proud of on the channel. Seriously, 2 hours long, and a lot of my JavaScript learning went into that video, and I'm super happy that people have actually watched it. Each of these types of content serves people in different ways. Again, the Notion feature coverage video helps people keep up to date on everything that's releasing, which this week is a lot.

And the build guides help people who want something specific in Notion. A lot of people want to have a tracker in Notion. A lot of people want an expense tracker in Notion. I can show them how to build those.

All of these act as beacons that help specific people at specific points find their way to the shore of my island where I built my brand and where I have templates for sale along with other things. I also wanna step away from just analyzing my content, things I've done for a second. I also wanna talk a little bit about Zapier's content strategy. I could bring up a whole lot of case studies, but Zapier's always stands up in my mind when I give these talks.

And I think they've done something really, really smart that you should pay attention to. So you might know that Zapier's product allows people to build automations between the different apps. Essentially, it's a tool that lets you use no code components to connect the different APIs together. So if you're running Zapier's marketing, how would you bring people into this tool?

How would you get their attention? Do you make a bunch of videos about APIs? Do you make a ton of hyper specific tutorials about how to connect your Fitbit step data to your Samsung smart fridge? Well, if you're doing only that, you're probably not running marketing at Zapier for very long because what they do is something quite a bit more intelligent.

And you can see it at work and you can see its results if you look up Zapier in a SEO tool like Ahrefs, or if you just Google things like the best calendar apps or the best CRM apps. You see, what Zapier has done is they created a bunch of content that casts wider net that targets a bigger group of people than just folks who need to connect 2 different APIs right now. And what they're doing with this strategy is they're bringing a lot more traffic into their blog and into their media properties. And crucially, this traffic, these people are people who are interested in these software tools.

And if people are interested in, say, Google Calendar or Notion or Excel or any of these online tools and APIs, some subsection of those people are going to have API connection needs. If you're using, say, a form builder like Notion forms, at some point, you're gonna be like, well, wait. How would I get my Notion form data into this other tool where there's not already an automation? Oh, Notion's got this web request tool that's coming out.

I could pipe that into a Zapier workflow. I could send all of that to, a database somewhere. Zapier is the tool I can use for that. And I know about Zapier because I looked at their CPM or their CRM tool list, and that's because Zapier invested a ton of time in creating all this wider content.

So hopefully this, along with my own case study, shows you a couple of strategies you can try. You can create content that directly addresses the needs of your target audience right away like I'm doing on Thomas Frank explains, but you can also cast the the net a little bit wider, go a little bit broader in your appeal, and talk about things that a slightly wider group of people would find interesting so long as that wider group contains the target group you're trying to reach. You probably don't wanna do drama videos about celebrities if you're trying to reach accountants, But maybe accountants are interested in business case study videos, and they find those interesting during lunchtime. Maybe you make videos about that, and you let people know, hey.

We have a really cool accounting tool. You also don't wanna stop at creating content. You can also launch search parties. And this is just another cool metaphor because I like cool metaphors for actually getting into the water and finding those ships and guiding them to your shore.

And luckily, you're doing that right now by coming to an event like Make with Notion. This is the place where you can build new relationships, you can strike up conversations, you can meet somebody who might be your next business partner, who might be your next client, who might be the person who buys your first template that you launch hopefully next week because you iterate fast and get feedback. Right? You can also do this online.

I spent again a ton of time in the Notion subreddit because I love solving formula problems for people. And some of those people have likely found their way back to my website, maybe even bought my templates, even if I'm not promoting them directly there because I'm there interacting in the community. And I'm also getting a firsthand view of the problems those people have. This is, I think, the most important reason why you want to go and launch these search parties, not just light lighthouses.

You wanna get out there, get face to face time, or at least screen to screen time with people who are in your target audience, and you wanna hear directly from them what their problems are and what you can do uniquely to solve them. And that brings me right back to, again, the one thing I hope you take away from this talk. If you remember nothing else, if my fly was undone and that stuck in your head instead of everything else, remember this, go find your problem. Even if it's small.

Build a minimum viable product. Don't wait too long to make it perfect, and launch. Get feedback as quickly as possible. Get a feedback cycle running.

The more iterations, the better. Because you've never been more connected to the people that you can help no matter where they are. You've never been more connected, and it's never been easier with no code components, with Notion, with all these tools we have access to. It's never been easier to build a unique and great solution for those people.
